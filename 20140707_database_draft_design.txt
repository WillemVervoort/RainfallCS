Using MySQL because this is what AERDM has, will make it easier to transfer.

Steps I took to get this installed and running:
1. Installed MySQL Community server 5.6 from the Oracle website
	Also installed the MySQL OBDC connecter
2. Followed the MySQL manual to create a database
3. Created a "dummy" user with access to the database following the manual on the web:
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/creating-database.html

4. Followed instructions from web search on how to connect RODBC to MySQL database
http://www.joyofdata.de/blog/make-r-talk-to-mysql-on-windows/

See file tables.sql for the new structure of the database

How to connect:
shell> mysql -u user -p
password:


You can now also run the tables.sql to create the tables using:
shell> mysql -u user -p < batch-file
Enter password: ********

Or you can run from the mysql prompt:
mysql> source filename;

RMSE (all Numeric)
r.sq
p-value
bias
stat1  (extra fields, maybe used later)
