Using MySQL because this is what AERDM has, will make it easier to transfer.

Steps I took to get this installed and running:
1. Installed MySQL Community server 5.6 from the Oracle website
	Also installed the MySQL OBDC connecter
2. Followed the MySQL manual to create a database
3. Created a "dummy" user with access to the database following the manual on the web:
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/creating-database.html

4. Followed instructions from web search on how to connect RODBC to MySQL database
